# Flutter OOP Story Application

## Project Description

This Flutter project contains a story application developed using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. The application allows users to make choices throughout the story, influencing the course of the narrative.

## Features

- Coded in accordance with OOP principles.
- User-friendly interface.
- User choices affect the outcome of the story.

## User Guide

When you run the application, a story begins, and users are required to make choices in response to specific events or situations. These choices impact the progression of the story, leading to different outcomes.

## Project Structure

The project includes the following key components:

- `main.dart`: The main entry point of the application, where the user interface is defined.
- `story.dart`: Defines the Story class and story elements.
- `story_brain.dart`: Contains the content of the stories and choices.
